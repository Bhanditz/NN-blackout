# NN-blackout
Purposefully slows loading of webpages to simulate what the internet would look like without Net Neutrality.

I've been thinking of developing a quick js script that web developers can use that will cause the website to go "down" on a pre-determined day. The script would basically just make the page look like it's loading really slowly and make the images super low resolution somehow and break other things; then after a few seconds a modal would pop saying "This is what the internet would look like without net neutrality... Tell the FCC that you support net neutrality".

The idea is that a ton of individual website owners would be able to just pop this script on their site to "opt-in" to a massive blackout of the web on a specific day. If they ever wanted to "opt-out" (say after we've won the internet back, or if they are concerned that it would go down on important days) they would just need to remove the call to this script.

IDEAS FOR "BREAKING WEBSITES":
-slow loading of all assets
-reduce image resolutions?
-break other parts?

IDEAS FOR MODAL TEXT:
"This is what the internet would look like without net neutrality... Tell the FCC that you support net neutrality" (link to EFF? or maybe gofccyourself.com?)
